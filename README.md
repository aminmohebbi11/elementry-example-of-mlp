## An elementary MPL example using Sequential layers



In this Notebook, I'll provide an elementary example of how to use the MPL network with Sequential layers. Specifically, I utilized the cifar10 dataset, which consists of 50,000 32x32 color training images and 10,000 test images, categorized into 10 classes. For additional information on the dataset, please visit the CIFAR homepage.

Although it's a small dataset, it provides ample opportunities to experiment with various models, techniques, and approaches.
